# Abstract
We investigate stock price informativeness during periods when firms grab attention from retail investors, in particular, who invest directly in firm stocks. We do so using an archival setting were direct investments of retail investors immediately precede or trail public discussions in investment-related social media forum. While the average price informativeness around changes in retail investment *[discuss the average result here.]*, the effect varies significantly by whether the investments preceded or trailed social media discussions that gathered retail investor attention. *[**maybe** add cross-sectional result here.] Our study adds to the discussion on how market participation of less sophisticated investors affects the informativeness of equity market prices.

# Introduction {#sec:intro}
Prior studies have debated how direct investment of less sophisticated investors may affect the market price informativeness (@). On one hand, direct investment from less sophisticated investors may lack information value and result in price movements less driven by information. Alternatively, these investors can serve the role of noise traders, increasing chances that more sophisticated investors trade on information while exploiting the increased liquidity (@Kyle1985). Lastly, some unsophisticated investors may hold valuable information and induce other less informed investors to corroborate (@Nofsinger1999). An empirical examination of this question was hindered by the difficulty of identifying direct investment of less sophisticated investors (@Boehmer2017) and by the lack of means to identify the motivation behind these direct investments. We investigate this question by using periods direct retail investment can be closely tied to retail investors' public discussion of specific firms, either closely before or after the investment.

Examining direct investment by retailers is particularly relevant concerning the recent changes in equity market composition (@).<!-- add more cites from Trello background readings here --> Bloomberg Intelligence provided an estimate in 2020 that recent surges in retail stock trading volume have rendered retail investors as a group to become the second-largest composition only next to equity market makers. Our investigation enhances our understanding how price informativeness might change in this new equity market environment.

We use two empirical approaches to overcome challenges in our investigation. While prior studies (@)identify innovative methods to identify trading volumes of equity investors

# Literature review {#sec:lit}
@Barber2020 examines whether new investment tool available through fintech innovation change the retail investment behavior. They conjecture that the game-like features and commission free trading in trading platform such as Robinhood induces excessive trading and inclination toward attention-grabbing stocks. They differentiate Robinhood users from more "traditional" retail investors to isolate the effect the Robinhood app has on investors seemingly new to trading stocks. They show that stocks experience abnormal negative returns after a Robinhood herding episode and attribute their finding to attention-induced trading.

1. @Barber2020
2. Does new investment tools---namely, Robinhood---available through fintech innovation change the retail investment behavior?
3. Yes
4. TAQ; use @Boehmer2017 algorithm to differentiate Robinhood users with other retail investors
5. Robinhood users are characerized as individuals more prone to attention-driven investment induced by features of the app.
6. The Robinhood "Top-Mover" list requires a minimum market cap of $300 million. So, a regression discuntinuity design is used to examine around the $300 million cutoff. 
$$
\begin{split}
userchg_{it} = \beta_0 & + \beta_1 I_{mktcap_{it>\$300m}} + \sum_{n=1}^N \beta_2^n(mktcap_{it}-\$300m)^n + \\
& \sum_{n=1}^N \beta_3^n(mktcap_{it}-\$300m)^n \times I_{mktcap_{it>\$300m}} + \varepsilon_{it}
\end{split}
$$
where the sample includes stocks with market cap $\in$[\$250 million, \$300 million] and $t$ is in daily intervals.
7. Three Robinhood outages. Isolates the effect of Robinhood trades
8. The paper characterizes Robinhood tradings generally as potential herding events and document subsequent abnormal negative returns after Robinhood trading. While mentioning Wallstreetbets, it does not differentiate various event types or information sharing behaviors. The paper is also written with a behavioral perspective on retail investors, focusing on attention-induces tradings. The paper cites several studies that document the positive side of Robinhood investors but does not directly comment on them.

2. How does investor attention and social interaction affect the trading and pricing of lottery stocks---stocks with returns highly skewed? The focus of the paper is to provide explanation to the lottery anomaly.
3. No
4. CRSP; IBES
5. Strong behavioral view of retail investors having non-traditional preference over lottery stocks.
6. $$
\begin{split}
R_{i,t+1} & = \sum_{\tau = H,M,L}\alpha_t^\tau D_{i,t}^\tau + \sum_{\tau = H,M,L}\beta_t^\tau(MAX_{i,t} \times SOCIAL_{i,t} \times D_{i,t}^\tau) \\
& + \lambda_{1,t}MAX_{i,t} + \lambda_{2,t}SOCIAL_{i,t} + \lambda_{3,t}RHLD_{i,t} + \lambda_{4,t}X_{i,t} + \varepsilon_{i,t+1}

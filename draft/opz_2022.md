# Abstract
We investigate stock price informativeness during periods when firms grab attention from retail investors, in particular, who invest directly in firm stocks. We do so using an archival setting were direct investments of retail investors immediately precede or trail discussions in investment-related social media forum. While the average price informativeness around changes in retail investment *[discuss the average result here.]*, the effect varies significantly by whether the investments preceded or trailed social media discussions that gathered retail investor attention. *[**maybe** add cross-sectional result here.] Our study adds to the discussion on how market participation of less sophisticated investors affects the informativeness of stock prices.

# Introduction {#sec:intro}
Prior studies have debated how direct investment of less sophisticated investors may affect the market price informativeness (@). On one hand, direct investment from less sophisticated investors may lack information value and result in price movements driven less by information. Alternatively, these investors can serve the role of noise traders, increasing chances that more sophisticated investors trade on information while exploiting the increased liquidity (@Kyle1985). Lastly, some unsophisticated investors may hold valuable information and induce other less informed investors to corroborate (@Nofsinger1999). An empirical examination of this question was hindered by the difficulty of identifying direct investment of less sophisticated investors and by the lack of means to identify the motivation behind the direct investment. We investigate this question by using periods retail direct investment can be closely tied to retail investors' discussion of specific firm, either closely before or after the investment.
